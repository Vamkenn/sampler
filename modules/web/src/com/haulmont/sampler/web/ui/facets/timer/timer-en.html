<p><code>Timer</code> is a non-visual component designed to run some screen controller code at specified time intervals.
    The timer works in a thread that handles user interface events, therefore it can update screen components. Timer
    stops working when a screen it was created for is closed.</p>

<p>Timers are described using the <code>timer</code> element.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>delay</code> - a required attribute; it defines timer interval in milliseconds;</li>

    <li><code>autostart</code> - an optional attribute; when it is set to <code>true</code>, timer starts immediately
        after the screen is opened. By default, the value is <code>false</code>, which means that the timer will start
        only when its <code>start()</code> method is invoked;
    </li>

    <li><code>repeating</code> - an optional attribute, turns on repeated executions of the timer. If the attribute is
        set to <code>true</code>, the timer runs in cycles at equal intervals defined in the <code>delay</code>
        attribute. Otherwise, the timer runs only once â€“ <code>delay</code> milliseconds after the timer start.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To execute some code on timer, subscribe to its <code>TimerActionEvent</code> in the screen controller.</p>
