<p><code>AggregationDistributionProvider</code> allows you to distribute aggregation value on data rows. It is invoked
    after aggregated value is manually changed.</p>
<p>It works only for <code>aggregationStyle="TOP"</code> mode. To enable aggregation distribution you need to set
    <code>&lt;aggregation editable="true"&gt;</code> in the column aggregation.</p>
