<p>The <code>TextChangeEventMode</code> defines the way the changes are transmitted to the server to cause a server-side
    event. There are 3 predefined event modes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><code>LAZY</code> (default) - an event is triggered when there is a pause in editing the text. The length of
            the pause can be modified with <code>setInputEventTimeout()</code>. A text change event is forced before a
            possible <code>ValueChangeEvent</code>, even if the user did not keep a pause while entering the text.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><code>TIMEOUT</code> - an event is triggered after a timeout period. If more changes are made during this
            period, the event sent to the server-side includes the changes made up to the last change. The length of the
            timeout can be set with <code>setInputEventTimeout()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><code>EAGER</code> - an event is triggered immediately for every change in the text content, typically caused
            by a key press. The requests are separate and are processed sequentially one after another. Change events
            are nevertheless communicated asynchronously to the server, so further input can be typed while event
            requests are being processed.
    </li>
</ul>
