<p>The <code>DetailsGenerator</code> is a callback interface that is used for showing the details for a specific row.
    To handle showing and hiding the details you should implement your own listener. For instance, in this sample, we
    handle opening the details in the <code>ItemClickAction</code> of <code>DataGrid</code> component.
